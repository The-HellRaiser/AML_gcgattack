Decarboxylation of the starting material: This is the first step in the synthesis of Marihuana Extract. The starting material is usually a plant material, such as marijuana. The plant material is placed in a decarboxylation oven, which is a special oven that heats the plant material to a temperature that is high enough to cause the carboxyl group in the plant material to break down and release carbon dioxide. This process is called decarboxylation. 2. Extraction of the cannabinoids: The next step in the synthesis of Marihuana Extract is to extract the cannabinoids from the plant material. This can be done by using a solvent, such as ethanol or hexane, to dissolve the cannabinoids in the plant material. The cannabinoids can then be separated from the plant material by using a filtration process.",1
